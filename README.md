# Escape Room Games Controller
 A simple all-in-one User Interface for Escape Rooms.
 
 ## What does it do? ##
 Not only is this a timer, with custom time options for duration and automatically displaying on the second monitor (the one inside the Escape room), it will also automatically play the backing track (which can be added at any time). It also has pause and resume features, something we did not have before so if for some reason you need to pause the game, you can without disrupting the timer or music.
 
 ## What problem does it solve? ##
 * Immersive backing tracks not being perfectly synced - now you can have time announcements within the backing track (if it suits the rooms theme, of course) and it will always exactly match the timer!
* Losing the correct time when problems occur - with the pause and resume buttons, if you have to stop a game for whatever reason (technical problem, someone needs the loo etc.) then you simply pause the timer and resume it when they're ready to continue!
