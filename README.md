# Media Player

## What is it? ##
The Media Player is exactly what it says in the title - it plays Media! It can play music or videos. It utilises Windows Media player alongside other controls created myself.

## Why? ##
I was bored and wanted to code something! :)

## Future Changes ##
I'm unsure if I will come back to this project any time soon, if at all. It was only a fun, quick project to kill some time! If I come back to it, likely changes (for now) would be:
* Change the colour scheme
* Updated GUI to be more user-friendly
* Allow the user on first use to mark where they store music so on subsequent launches, it loads immediately
